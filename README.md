### Notes:

1. **Postman Collection**: You can either link to a hosted Postman collection or include the collection file in the repository if it's available locally.
2. **Sample JSON**: The provided example JSON in the README is a sample request body that should match the expected input of your API.
3. **API Endpoint**: Ensure that the endpoint (`POST /bid`) matches the one in your PHP script. The endpoint is `/` by default if you're using the PHP built-in server.

This README will guide users through the setup, testing process, and troubleshooting for your Campaign Bid Request API.
